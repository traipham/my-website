# my-website
This is my own personal website. It will include my Resume, Interest, Wish list, Goals, Blogs, and other random features that I find interesting. The website will be created using React.JS, JSX, and CSS. I'll be using some type of database(7/19/202) but will figure this out in the future.(Most likely a Documented-based DB like MongoDB). I hope to finalize this soon. I'm learning React.JS at the same time as creating this website.
